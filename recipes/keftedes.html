    <h1>Keftedes</h1>
    <img src="../images/keftedes.webp" alt="Keftedes on a plate" width="800">
    <p>A family favorite straight from the village of Kyparissia. Serve as an appetizer or with tzatziki, Greek salata, and pita or pasta for a full meal. They taste best served at room temp and make for wonderful leftovers. If you don't care for lamb, try using all beef instead.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices white bread, torn into pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons dried mint</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound ground lamb</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
      <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Moisten the bread pieces with the milk in a large bowl, and set aside</li>
      <li>Mince the garlic in a food processor, then add the onion, mint, salt, and pepper. Process until the onion is finely chopped.</li>
      <li>Add the onion mixture to the bowl with the moist bread, along with the beef, lamb, and eggs. Mix with your hands until thoroughly blended.</li>
      <li>Roll the mixture into balls measuring 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.</li>
      <li>Place the flour in a shallow pan, and roll the balls in the flour to coat. Shake off any excess flour, and place the meatballs onto a plate or baking sheet, pressing to flatten slightly. This will keep them from rolling away.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs, 8 or 10 at a time, and cook until nicely browned on the outside, and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Drain meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
